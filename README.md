1. After displaying the welcome screen, we need to press the appropriate button
corresponding to each die. We roll the dice one by one. <br>
S2 - die #1, S3 - die #2, S4 - die #3 <br>
2. After pressing the appropriate button, we swipe the screen with our finger,
and a message about the result of the roll will be displayed. <br>
3. After each roll, we can check the current results under button S1. <br>
4. Each die can be rolled a maximum of 3 times. <br>
5. You win if you score a total of 13 points. <br>
6. If you did not score the required number of points after using all possible rolls - you lose.
